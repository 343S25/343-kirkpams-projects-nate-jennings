                        <p>The goal of B-Cal is to provide all users with an intuitive way to track their
                        spending all while integrating a calendar with full Holiday support to allow for better
                        financial planning. Many people struggle to maintain a budget due to a lack of visibility
                        into their day to day expenses. Traditional budgeting tools often require bulky manual
                        entry into a spreadsheet or a complex app that is often not user friendly and often not
                        able to be used after checkout; when most expenses are imputed.</p>
                        
                        <p>B-Cal aims to simplify expense tracking by allowing users to simply click on a
                        specific date within their calendar and enter their expenses for that day. By associating
                        expenses with specific dates, users can identify spending patterns and adjust their
                        habits accordingly. Additionally, displaying holidays, which are gotten from an external
                        API helps users anticipate any expected change in spending behavior due to events.</p>
                        
                        <p>This application is very important as it helps to promote financial literacy and
                        helps its users develop good spending habits all while keeping a simplistic approach to
                        the often overdone finance software.</p>
