    <ol>
        <li>The git repository has been created.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>It support small screens for something like an iphone to use and 
            has a comment in the css saying where that is.
        </li>
        <li>I have 3 pages as the spec got moved down to only needing 2.</li>
        <li>There is a header at the top of the screen.</li>
        <li># include nav linl #</li>
        <li>The logo on the top right has an alt text.</li>
        <li>It passes both Nu and WAVE</li>
        <li>I use 2 differnet fonts</li>
        <li>Index.html has a text form</li>
        <li>In the modem i link a button to the daily nasdaq so that you can see how the market is doing that day before you spend any money.</li>
        <li> I use 2 fetches to both Icanhazdadjoke and openholidays. I use the hollidays to add them to the 
            calendar so that you can account for mor spending on the hollidays. The dad joke is on the modem when the user inputs
            spending so they dont feel as bad about spening money.
